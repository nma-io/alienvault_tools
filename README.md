* Much of this is from reading through the code I have access to. 
* I probably got things wrong and items may corrupt your databases or break processes.
* I could definitely tighten the code up and make it faster. Much of this is for quick 'break fixes' 
* I will revisit the code periodically if needed.

Applications:  

otx_cleanup.py  ==  Add Post Processing whitelist and remove observables from older pulses - Run as a cronjob?

update_all_the_scan_things.sh == Will update all of the scanning related tools (including GEOIP, Nikto, OpenVAS and NMAP)
